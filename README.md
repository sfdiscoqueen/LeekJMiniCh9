// Mini-Challenge #9 "Restaurant Picker"
// This is a program that asks the user to pick a type of cuisine, then prints a restaurant suggestion

// peer review: Pedro Castaneda - Great use of switch statements! Your code is very clever and keeps your code looking clean. Your validation had no bugs and worked great!. I definately took away some great ideas for my own code in later use. Great work.
